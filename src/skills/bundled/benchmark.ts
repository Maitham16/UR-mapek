Add or run benchmarks for a specific component in an isolated worktree. Collect results, compare variants if requested, and optionally commit the benchmark code and results.

## Setup

1. Use the ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} tool with "isolation: worktree" and model "route: auto" to create a fresh git worktree and branch named "ur/benchmark-<timestamp>-<slug>". UR will pick a cheap or strong model based on the benchmark complexity.
2. Identify the target component and the existing benchmark tooling (e.g., <code>benchmark</code>, <code>denote</code>, <code>vitest bench</code>, <code>hyperfine</code>, shell <code>time</code>).

## Plan

1. State the metric you will measure (latency, throughput, memory, correctness, etc.).
2. Decide whether to add a new benchmark file or run an existing one.
3. If comparing implementations, keep the baseline and the candidate as close as possible.

## Execute

1. Write or run the benchmark. Keep it deterministic where possible and document stochastic variance.
2. Run it several times and record the results.
3. If a change was required to add the benchmark, commit it with "bench(scope): add benchmark for X".
4. If results should persist, save them in a consistent format (e.g., JSON, markdown table).

## Finish

1. Push the branch only if code or saved results were committed.
2. Open a PR with:
   - Title: "bench(scope): <short description>"
   - Body: what was benchmarked, command, results, and interpretation.

Return a concise summary: branch name, commits, PR URL (if any), and the results.
